            <p>Doing something for society especially women has always been my true motive. A woman is a god, mother,
                child, nature and many more.
                I would take all steps in my boundaries to protect women and thier rights. <i>~Pragya Paramita Sahoo</i>
            </p>

            <p>In this world where women are in danger I just want to help each and every women out there.
                My inspiration are many activist women who have helped and worked relentlessly to protect and educate
                womanhood.

            <p>Today, more than ever, women are enjoying freedom. They can decide on their own.
                However, there is a long way to go. Women must protest against the use of religion to suppress them.
                Not all military positions are open to females. There is a wage gap in the film industry, in sports and
                normal jobs.
                The women need to use their hard-earned power to banish all the injustices that they have been facing
                for time immemorial.
                Women must be given equal opportunities in every field, irrespective of gender.
                Moreover, they must also be given equal pay. We can empower women by abolishing child marriage.
                Various programs must be held where they can be taught skills to fend for themselves in case they face
                financial crisis.
